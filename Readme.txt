using jupyter notebook to start to run:-

To train the model:
- Import and Install Dependencies 
- Keypoints using MP Holistic "Press q while raising your left hand when the webcam opens to capture keypoints".
- Extract Keypoint Values.
- Setup Folders for Collection.
- Collect Keypoint Values for Training and Testing.
- Preprocess Data and Create Labels and Features.
- Build and Train LSTM Neural Network 
- Make Predictions.
- Save Weights "this is your trained model 'action222.h5' .
- Evaluation using Confusion Matrix and Accuracy.
- Test in Real Time  .

To test the model:
- Install the model in your device 'action222.h5' .
- Import and Install Dependencies .
- Keypoints using MP Holistic "Press q while raising your left hand when the webcam opens to capture keypoints".
- Extract Keypoint Values.
- Run the commented code that it is at the beginning of the 'Test in Real Time' .
- Test in Real Time "set a number of colors appropriate to the number of words you have in the model " .
